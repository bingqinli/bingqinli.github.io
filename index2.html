          I grew up in China, where I studied economics and worked in finance. I then came to LSE to study social policy, and later joined the faculty here. In 2013 I moved to Australia, and took up an Associate Professor position at the Crawford School. In 2016 I moved to UNSW to become the Director of the Chinese Social Policy Program.

          I research housing, urbanization, migration, urban governance, social policy reform, and development more broadly. Much of my work has a China or Asia focus, but by no means all. I am particularly interested in comparing policies between Asia and the West, and have recently started a major project looking at how communities in different countries facilitate local employment. My teaching experience includes core social policy and social economics courses, as well as courses on housing and migration. Consulting experience includes the World Bank, EU, UN Habitat, and the Chinese government.
